    <p>Hi! I'm Keirdre Casinillo, currently studying web development at BYU-Idaho. I enjoy exploring how technology can solve real-world problems and make people’s lives better. In my free time, I love learning new programming languages, editing videos, and playing strategy games. I'm excited to keep improving my skills so I can build creative websites, apps, and maybe even a game someday!</p>
